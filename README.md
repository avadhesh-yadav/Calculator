# Simple Calculator

This project is a simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. Use the buttons to input numbers and operators.
4. Press '=' to calculate the result.
5. Press 'C' to clear the input.

## Features

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Error handling for invalid expressions

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [math.js](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjs/10.0.0/math.min.js) library for mathematical evaluation

## How It Works

- The JavaScript code listens for button clicks and updates the input accordingly.
- When the '=' button is clicked, the input expression is evaluated using the `math.js` library.
- Any errors in the expression are caught and displayed in red.

Feel free to modify and customize the code according to your needs!
